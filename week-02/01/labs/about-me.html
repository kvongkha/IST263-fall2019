<p>I am a Senior studying Information Management & Technology. After sschool, I plan on moving back to the West Coast. I wish to puruse a career that allows me to do technology in the retail and fashion industry. </p>
<p>Originally from Seattle, I enjoy hiking in the outdoors, running, hot yoga, and taking my dog Milo for walks.</p>
<p>Recently, I have been into making matcha lattes and finding new recipes to make while I am away from my Mom's home-cooked meals.</p>
