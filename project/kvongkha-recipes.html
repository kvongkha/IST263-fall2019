            <h2>Chicken Pho</h2>
            <article>
                <header class="date">
                    <h2>October 19, 2019</h2>
                    <img src="./media/pho.jpg" alt="Pho">
                    <p>Pho is a classic Vietnamese noodle soup bowl. This recipe is for a chicken broth rather than the beef broth you will typically have at a restaurant.
                    My mom used to always make the beef broth, but ever since my Uncle from France visited Seattle and shared his chicken broth recipe, my mom has only made this broth ever since.
                    I do like the chicken broth better because it is more light and usually less salty than the beef. The ingredients list may look intimidating, but pho includes a variety of toppings and condiments.
                    We typically use all of it from bean sprouts to garlic chili oil, but it is up to you! 
                    One note to add about this recipe is that the longer the pho broth is boiled, the better the taste and flavor. Enjoy!</p>

                    <p>Also known as Red Curry, this dish is easy to make as long as you have the right ingredients. My family loves to have
                        our curry over rice. There is the perfect balance of protein and veggies in the dish. What makes this spicy is the curry paste,
                        so based on your liking add as little or as much as you'd like.

                    <p>Are they called egg rolls or spring rolls? On the West Coast, we call them egg rolls when they are fried while spring rolls 
                        are wrapped with the clear rice paper and are therefore transparent. Living on the East Coast for three years, I find that the
                        names are interchangable. What do you think? Why do I see egg rolls named as spring rolls?
                        This bite-size, crunchy, and savory appetizer is the perfect dish to bring as a potluck item!

                </ul>
                <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Soak vermicelli noodles into warm water.</li>
                    <li>Finely slice carrots and mushrooms, dice yellow/white and green onion, and garlic cloves. </li>
                    <li>In a large mixing bowl, add meat, diced yellow/white onion, diced green onion, and 3 eggs.</li>
                    <li>Add all sliced veggies: carrots, mushrooms, taro root, and noodles. Mix well with a spoon or spatula.</li>
                    <li>Add all of the spices: 2 tbsp of kosher salt, 2 tbsp of soy sauce, black pepper, and white pepper. Then mix again!</li>
                    <li>Once all of the ingedients have been combined, cover the bowl with Saran Wrap and refridgerate it for 15 minutes or longer.</li>
                    <li>Time is up! Take out our egg roll mix from the fridge. Scoop some of the mixture with a spoon and place it in the middle of the egg roll wrap.</li>
                    <li>Fold each side tightly and continue to roll the wrap until the end.</li>
                    <li>Continue to wrap and roll using all of the mixture or you can save it for later. </li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, in a cooking pot, add vegetable oil just enough to cover the egg rolls once they are placed in the pot.</li>
                    <li>Place your egg rolls in the oil over medium-high heat. Cook egg rolls for about 15 minutes or until they are golden brown.</li>
                    <li>Remove from pot and place it over a napkin for the oil to soak. Enjoy with fish sauce!</li>
