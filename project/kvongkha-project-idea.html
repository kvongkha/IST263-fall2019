<h1>Karissa's Project Idea</h1>
</head>
<body>
<p>My project idea stemmed from my love for food. I knew I wanted to do something around creating a resource of recipes and various dishes. At home, I was brought up eating <abbr title="Southeast Asian">SEA</abbr> food. My mother is an amazing cook who is my primary resource for creating content. There are also Youtubers and recipes that people share online. Of course I will have to ask their permission to use their images and reference inforamtion.</p>
