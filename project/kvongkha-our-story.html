                    <h2>Where it all began...</h2>
                </header>
                <p>My mother and father were both from Laos, an unfamiliar country to most people. Laos is a landlocked country that sits in between Thailand and Vietnam while also bordering China in the north, Myanmar in the northwest, and Cambodia in the south. 
                    At a young childhood age, they both moved to Seattle, Washington with their families. My mother who is the youngest of three sisters grew up in a single-parent household where she learned how to be self-sufficient in many ways including cooking. 
                    With a background of both Lao and Thai roots, she learned how to cook various Southeast Asian dishes by simply going to friend gatherings with her father. 
                    She also grew up learning Vietnamese cuisine from her sister’s in-laws who are from Vietnam. 
                    Later in her life, she married my father who has a family of fifteen siblings; and from then, her knowledge of Southeast Asian cuisine expanded. 
                    Through an extensive tree of relationships with family and friends, she was able to grasp the different tips and tricks from various people in which she then created and honed her own methods. 
                    My mom's cooking is special, and anyone else who has had her cooking can attest to that. My aunts would request her spring rolls for their party or when we invite guests over for a pot of ka-poon, 
                    everyone wants another bowl of the spicy and savory noodle soup. </p>
                <h2>Why share our recipes?</h2>
                <p>Lao, Thai, and Vietnamese cuisine is a significant part of my childhood and culture. 
                    Now that I am in college which happens to be two-thousand miles away from home, I crave my mom’s home-cooked pho, khao-piek senh (Lao Rice Noodle Soup), papaya salad, spring rolls, and the list continues. 
                    As I am in my Senior year, I become tired of the selection at the dining halls and I continue to want the Asian food I grew up eating. 
                    Sharing these recipes is not only helpful for me cooking in my apartment, but for others who are interested in Thai, Lao, and/or Vietnamese cuisine. 
                    Finding a Pho restaurant on Yelp is easy however, cooking at home and making something for yourself and for others is rewarding. 
                    I always feel proud when I make something that’s just as delicious as I hoped it would be. 
                    My mom cooks for my family and for events because food brings people together; it is the best gift you could give.</p>
